  Dino Muradian (Dumitru Muradian) was born in Romania to a half-Armenian, half-Hungarian father and a Romanian mother. He was introduced to pyrography at the age of seven by his grandfather, and it became his main hobby as his life took many interesting twists and turns. He graduated in 1977 from the Romanian Aviation Academy in Bobocu, Romania, and worked as a commercial airplane pilot until the summer of 1983, when Dino defected from regime of communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu on a small Antonov An-2 crop-duster. He spent five months in a refugee camp in Austria, and arrived in the U.S. as a political refugee in early 1984.
